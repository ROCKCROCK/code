1>> (Pointers to objects) Define a class Item that is used to store and display the information
regarding the item number and its price. Write a program to store and display the details of
one items by using both normal object and pointer to object separately. Display appropriate
message wherever necessary.
2>> Modify the program LE8.1 by creating an array of n objects using pointers. Show the details of n 
items by using pointers to object concept.
3>> (Pointers to derived classes) Write a program to illustrate how pointers to a base class is used
for both base and derived class.
4>> (this Pointer) Write a program to display the contains of an object, when local variable's
name is same as member's name by using this pointer.
5>> (Virtual Function) Define a class ABC. Derive two classes BBC and KBC from ABC. All
the classes contains same member function name as display(). The base class pointer always
holds the derived class objects.
a) Write a program such that base class pointer or reference will always access/call the base
version of the members available in derived class, do not have any access to the derived
class members.
b) Write a program such that base class pointer or reference will always access/call the
derived version of the members available in derived class, do not have any access to the
base class members.
Write down the concepts used for bit a) and b) separately.
6>> (Pure Virtual Function) Write a program by modifying LE8.5 b) by making display() as
pure virtual function.
